# Welcome to the Fusionbase API

We believe that working with data, specifically the exploration and integration part, should be fun! Therefore, our API is designed to seamlessly support a data scientist's and engineer's daily work.

The Fusionbase API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication and verbs.

If you have questions, feel free to [reach out!](mailto:info@fusionbase.com)
